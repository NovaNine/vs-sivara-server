      -- Curing Rack
Curing rack shapes have been modified to better fit the Vintage Story aesthetic.

The curing rack can now be used for drying objects, storage, as well as curing. They just need to have an onCuringRackProps attribute(detailed in a guide in the resources folder on the mod GitHub)

Added compatibility for Expanded Foods, Primitive Survival, and Wildcraft. Various items can be hung on the curing rack from each mod.

-- Other
Updated the Japanese language file(thank you, Macoto Hino!)

Stretching Frame shape has been modified to better fit the Vintage Story aesthetic.

Expanded Foods grindables now have their own custom meshes for the mortar.

Lowered drop rates of brains, now 25% chance for smaller animals, and 35% for larger animals.

The chamberstick blocks now emit a warmer hue.

Unwanted bark baskets can now be burned as fuel.
